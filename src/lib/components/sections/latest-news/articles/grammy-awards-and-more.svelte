		The first round of voting for the Grammy Awards ‘25 opened with Raie’s album Red Brick<br />
		Angel placed in the Country &amp; American Roots Music for Best Americana Album.<br />
		<br />
		This work of original songs, produced by Wes Maebe and created by Raie with Wes and her<br />
		band of superb musicians, is recognised for its excellence and its authenticity by a worldwide<br />
		organisation!<br />
		<br />
		It’s the best outcome imaginable for the ending of ‘24.<br />
		<br />
		We are proud and very happy … and spurred on to write and create more music … our<br />
		upcoming album is ‘in the making’.<br />
		<br />
		Meanwhile the film of our Raie on the Sofa gig is in the edit stage …<br />
		<br />
		… the gig was filmed at Raie’s home in late October ’24 by Jon Klein and Keiko Yamazo.<br />
		Jon has already edited the images beautifully … but Wes is a busy guy so we’re in the<br />
		‘Wesonator queue’ for the sound to be mixed and mastered …<br />
		<br />
		Watch this space …. ’25 here we come!
